# toxicity-prediction-x2022gmo
Toxicity Prediction Challenge on Kaggle

### Code for generating rdkit molecular descriptors is in `molecular_desc.ipynb`

## Steps to run the fully Reproducible code 

1. Open the link - https://www.kaggle.com/code/x2022gmo/x2022gmo-best-submission
2. Click on edit on the top of the link and a copied version is created. 
3. After creating that change the accelarator to GPU and start the session.
4. Also check if all datasets are downloaded into the dataset folder.
4. Start running the code to generate the output file.
